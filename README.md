## File Structure
We use the component approach in our starter. This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic. A component is basically a self contained app usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, e2e, and component class. Here's how it looks:

angular2-webpack-starter/
 ├──src/                       * our source files that will be compiled to javascript
 |   ├──main.ts                * our entry file for our browser environment
 │   │
 |   ├──index.html             * Index.html: where we generate our index page
 │   │
 |   ├──polyfills.ts           * our polyfills file
 │   │
 │   ├──app/                   * WebApp: folder
 │   │   ├──app.spec.ts        * a simple test of components in app.ts
 │   │   ├──app.e2e.ts        * a simple end-to-end test for /
 │   │   └──app.ts             * App.ts: a simple version of our App component components
 │   │
 │   └──assets/                * static assets are served here
 │       ├──icon/              * our list of icons from www.favicon-generator.org
 │       ├──service-worker.js  * ignore this. Web App service worker that's not complete yet
 │       ├──robots.txt         * for search engines to crawl your website
 │       └──human.txt          * for humans to know who the developers are
 │
 ├──spec-bundle.js             * ignore this magic that sets up our angular 2 testing environment
 ├──karma.config.js            * karma config for our unit tests
 ├──protractor.config.js       * protractor config for our end-to-end tests
 │
 ├──tsconfig.json              * config that webpack uses for typescript
 ├──typings.json               * our typings manager
 ├──package.json               * what npm uses to manage it's dependencies

 └──webpack.prod.config.js     * our production webpack config

## Running the app
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm run server` to start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000` (or if you prefer IPv6, if you're using `express` server, then it's `http://[::1]:3000/`).

### server
bash
# development
npm run server
# production
npm run build:prod
npm run server:prod


## Other commands

### build files
# development
npm run build:dev
# production
npm run build:prod

### watch and build files
npm run watch

### run tests
npm run test
